The following are recommended VA Git repository types. Further repository customizations may be needed based upon team and/or product need.      

| Team or Product | Example(s) |  Repository Type(s)    | Notes |
|:--------------|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|
|VA Service Team| ⦁ Release Readiness Office<br> ⦁ EPMO CMD|⦁ product repository| Service teams tend to source control documentation artifacts only. |
|VA Product| ⦁ BIO BIS <br>⦁ EPRS<br>⦁ VDIF|⦁ product repository<br>⦁ code-project repository | VA products tend to source control both documentation and code artifacts. These repositories are based on code base and architecture. |
|VA Infrastructure-only Product| ⦁ VA WiFi Lifecycle Refresh<br>⦁ Enterprise Endpoint Security|⦁ product repository<br>⦁ code-project repository| VA Infrastructure products can source control both documentation artifacts and Infrastructure-specific artifacts based on what is being delivered |
|Other|  |⦁ product repository<br>⦁ code-project repository | Repository types determined based on code base and architecture |

**Note:** Git repositories function similarly to Rational components in that they house source artifact files and folders. However, base-lining will work differently in VA Git repositories.
